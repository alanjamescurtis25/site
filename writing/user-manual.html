            <p><strong>Last Updated: 10.22.25</strong></p>
            <p>For people who work with me, this ‚ÄúUser Manual‚Äù is a guide to better collaboration and outcomes. It‚Äôs a living document and if you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôd welcome your feedback!</p>
            <p><strong>How I Think</strong></p>

            <p>Explore</p>
            <p>Definition: Go and see for yourself</p>
            <p>Quote: I'm not interested in whether the glass is half empty or half full. I'm interested in figuring out how to fill the glass.</p>

            <p>Evolve</p>
            <p>Definition: Relentless improvement</p>
            <p>Quote: Take a simple idea and take it seriously</p>

            <p>Explain</p>
            <p>Definition: What's not being said</p>
            <p>Quote: A person's success in life can be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations they are willing to have</p>
            <p><strong>How I Act</strong></p>

            <p>1. Wartime CEO</p>
            <p>Definition: Hyper-rational, solutions oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Steady hand in a crisis</p>
            <p>Weakness: Default to binary thinking</p>

            <p>2. Coach</p>
            <p>Definition: Empathetic and motivational, teaching oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Teambuilding</p>
            <p>Weakness: Not everyone wants or needs coaching!</p>

            <p>3. Victim</p>
            <p>Definition: Why is this happening to me, self-pity oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Root cause analysis</p>
            <p>Weakness: Complaining and dropping baggage on others</p>

            <p>4. Kid</p>
            <p>Definition: Fun "big kid" playing with daughters, escape oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Fun</p>
            <p>Weakness: Goes too far with teasing</p>
            <p>The TL;DR summary here is that I like building systems that tell the truth. In organizations, in relationships, in crisis, in‚Ä¶pretty much anything. When we have <em>the truth</em> we can make better decisions to continuously improve that system.</p>
            <p><strong>How I Communicate</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When sending - direct, blunt, to the point verbally and written. "Can I be wildly candid with you?"</li>
                <li>When receiving - prefer the same, little patience for long winded, spin, or dishonesty. "Get to the point!"</li>
                <li>With feedback - just hit me as hard as you can, in as close to real-time as you can. "Don't pull your punches!"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How I Communicate‚Ä¶Tactically</strong></p>

            <p>Urgency</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Urgent - call me direct and we'll problem solve</li>
                <li>Non-urgent - send me a memo or a voice memo with a time you want an answer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Mediums</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meetings - please no more meetings! If we have to, keep it organized and useful (everyone rates it a 10/10)</li>
                <li>Messages (email, Telegram, Slack) - please tag me if you need urgent answer, otherwise I batch at EoD</li>
                <li>Documents - use a classic memo format, I do heavily judge the quality of your memos and emails</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Quirks, Peeves, and Triggers</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am extremely fidget-y (I can't work sitting down) and bite my nails when I'm feeling anxious</li>
                <li>I hate when documents have margins greater than .1 inches! Wasting space!</li>
                <li>It drives me nuts when people don't have agendas for meetings and can't manage the clock</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Surprising Facts</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I can do extroverted work well, but I'm actually an introvert and prefer alone time to read, think, write, etc</li>
                <li>I can't wrap up my day and sleep soundly without inbox zero, no unread messages, a plan for tomorrow, etc</li>
                <li>I have a monthly newsletter for family and friends <em>instead of</em> using social media to stay in touch</li>
            </ul>
