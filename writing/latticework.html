            <h1>Latticework</h1>

            <p> ‚Äú<em>You‚Äôve got to have models in your head and you‚Äôve got to array you experience ‚Äì both vicarious and direct ‚Äì onto this latticework of mental models‚Ä¶.fortunately, it isn‚Äôt that tough‚Äîbecause eighty or ninety important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight</em>.‚Äù <strong>Charlie Munger.</strong></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The brain is a factory, not a warehouse. I have just enough room for a few pieces of wisdom. Here they are‚Ä¶</p>
            <p><strong>Build or Buy</strong></p>
            <p>Build gets customization, takes long, incurs debt. Buy is presets, fast, and replaceable. Think carefully when selecting.</p>
            <p><strong>Burn Dirty or Burn Clean Fuel</strong></p>
            <p>Run away from something you don't want to be (dirty) or towards something you want to be (clean)</p>
            <p><strong>Constraint Theory in the Value Chain to Find Leverage</strong></p>
            <p>Identify the system's bottleneck and exploit it</p>
            <p><strong>Dee Hock's Wisdom Funnel</strong></p>
            <p>Noise ‚Äî> Data ‚Äî> Information ‚Äî> Knowledge ‚Äî> Understanding ‚Äî> Wisdom</p>
            <p>Spend less time at the top of the funnel trying to accumulate data and information and more time converting understanding to wisdom</p>
            <p><strong>Focus on the Fundamentals</strong></p>
            <p>Do the basics excellently</p>
            <p><strong>Grey Thinking / Third Way</strong></p>
            <p>Avoid the binary, find the answer in the middle</p>
            <p><strong>In Media Res</strong></p>
            <p>Just get started, rip the bandaid off, and do it now</p>
            <p><strong>Invert, Always Invert</strong></p>
            <p>What does it look like to do X wrong? Now avoid that at all costs</p>
            <p><strong>Just in Time or Just in Case</strong></p>
            <p>Adapt or plan ahead</p>
            <p><strong>LIFO (Lindy Effect) or FIFO (Hacker News Syndrome)</strong></p>
            <p>Idea lasts as long as it's been around vs chasing a shiny object.</p>
            <p><strong>Path Dependency</strong></p>
            <p>Past events or decisions constrain later events. One ways doors.</p>
            <p><strong>Race your Strengths</strong></p>
            <p>Focus on what you're good at, don't try to become well-rounded and work on weaknesses</p>
            <p><strong>Right Person Right Seat</strong></p>
            <p>Does this person match your values and do they Get It, Want It, and have Capacity to do it</p>
            <p><strong>Run the Simulation</strong></p>
            <p>Think it through in detail, scenario plan</p>
            <p><strong>Strategic. Operational. Tactical.</strong></p>
            <p>Strategic - the why. Operational - the how. Tactical - the what.</p>
            <p><strong>What's Not Being Said</strong></p>
            <p>Say the thing, the taboo thing, that no one else wants to say but everyone is thinking</p>
