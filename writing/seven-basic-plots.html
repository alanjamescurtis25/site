            <h1>Seven Basic Plots</h1>

            <p>Turns out there are really only seven narratives. Every story, every person, and every company are living one of these stories. Can switch stories at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Overcoming the Monster</strong></p>
            <p>Definition: The protagonist sets out to defeat an antagonistic force (often evil) that threatens the protagonist and/or protagonist's homeland.</p>
            <p><strong>Rags to Riches</strong></p>
            <p>Definition: The poor protagonist acquires power, wealth, and/or a mate, loses it all and gains it back, growing as a person as a result.</p>
            <p><strong>The Quest</strong></p>
            <p>Definition: The protagonist and companions set out to acquire an important object or to get to a location. They face temptations and other obstacles along the way.</p>
            <p><strong>Voyage and Return</strong></p>
            <p>Definition: The protagonist goes to a strange land and, after overcoming the threats it poses or learning important lessons unique to that location, they return with experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Comedy</strong></p>
            <p>Definition: Light and humorous character with a happy or cheerful ending; a dramatic work in which the central motif is the triumph over adverse circumstance, resulting in a successful or happy conclusion.</p>
            <p><strong>Tragedy</strong></p>
            <p>Definition: The protagonist is a hero with a major character flaw or great mistake which is ultimately their undoing. Their unfortunate end evokes pity at their folly and the fall of a fundamentally good character.</p>
            <p><strong>Rebirth</strong></p>
            <p>Definition: An event forces the main character to change their ways and often become a better individual.</p>
