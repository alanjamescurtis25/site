            <p>Five prompts, ranked by impact (easy first), to review by yourself, your family, your team, etc. These prompts sit alongside goal review and planning.</p>

            <p><strong>Historian</strong></p>
            <p>Ten years from now, you look back at this year, what's the headline? What's the story of the year?</p>

            <p><strong>Consultant</strong></p>
            <p>What were your three biggest accomplishments, challenges, and failures across personal, relationship, and professional domains. Make a 3x3 diagram and have some fun. These grids serve as great visuals in the future when you're wondering "what the hell happened in 2016 again?"</p>

            <p><strong>Therapist</strong></p>
            <p>What behaviors, habits, people, situations, etc held you back? Where did you feel most alive? Be specific.</p>

            <p><strong>Coach</strong></p>
            <p>What feedback have you received, and how have you acted upon it? Be specific.</p>

            <p><strong>Self</strong></p>
            <p>Write yourself an email outlining your goals, thoughts, and intentions for the year and have it auto-sent for exactly one year into the future</p>

            <p>And one extra-credit exercise that's <em>really hard,</em> but very effective. The Eulogy. Write your own eulogy! Imagine at least three speakers across family, friends, etc. What do they say about you?</p>
