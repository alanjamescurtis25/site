            <p>Five prompts, ranked by impact (easy first), to review by yourself, your family, your team, etc. These prompts sit alongside goal review and planning.</p>

            <h3>Historian</h3>
            <p>Ten years from now, you look back at this year, what's the headline? What's the story of the year?</p>

            <h3>Consultant</h3>
            <p>What were your three biggest accomplishments, challenges, and failures across personal, relationship, and professional domains. Make a 3x3 diagram and have some fun. These grids serve as great visuals in the future when you're wondering "what the hell happened in 2016 again?"</p>

            <h3>Therapist</h3>
            <p>What behaviors, habits, people, situations, etc held you back? Where did you feel most alive? Be specific.</p>

            <h3>Coach</h3>
            <p>What feedback have you received, and how have you acted upon it? Be specific.</p>

            <h3>Self</h3>
            <p>Write yourself an email outlining your goals, thoughts, and intentions for the year and have it auto-sent for exactly one year into the future</p>

            <p>And one extra-credit exercise that's <em>really hard,</em> but very effective. The Eulogy. Write your own eulogy! Imagine at least three speakers across family, friends, etc. What do they say about you?</p>

            <p><strong>Asset class lifecycle:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Organized in a "system of record"</li>
                <li>Valued</li>
                <li>Financialized (traded, insured, bundled, etc)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Some asset classes, like crypto, speed run this process because they are already organized, literally on a ledger, and have built in pricing / valuation, so it's easy to become highly financialized. Some asset classes take decades to develop. So where is the best place to invest or build?</p>

            <p><strong>1. Build the system of record "picks and shovels" business</strong></p>
            <p>For example, Zillow for Real Estate, CME for Commodities, CBOE for Derivatives, Carta for startup stock, etc. These are all effectively vertically integrated software businesses that have built a monopoly.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Get really good at valuation</strong></p>
            <p>Either as a service provider doing the spreadsheets, or as a professional investor arbitraging valuation insight and buying the asset directly. Basically, Deloitte or Berkshire are the two ends of the continuum for this one.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Create new financialization in an established asset class</strong></p>
            <p>There are only a few options here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make it easier to trade the asset</li>
                <li>Make a derivative or a structured products of the asset</li>
                <li>Lend / borrow against the asset AKA securitization</li>
                <li>Insure / hedge the asset</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So that means, with any asset class there are really only SEVEN total options. Each asset class can be broken down, based on maturity, to better assess where in the value chain to invest or build.</p>

            <p><strong>Some hypotheses I'd like to test / backtest:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>SoR businesses are wildly undervalued in the first decade-ish of their rise</li>
                <li>You should NOT ever buy assets directly unless you have a material edge</li>
                <li>Investing in the leading service businesses doing valuation offer the best risk-adjusted returns</li>
                <li>Investing in the emerging fund managers targeting the asset class offers the next best risk-adjusted return</li>
                <li>Building or investing at the financialized level is the hardest and most competitive, but most lucrative</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A Business Operating System (BOS) is a <em>comprehensive</em> framework that integrates the core processes, tools, principles, and methodologies necessary for an organization to plan, execute, monitor, and improve its operations. A "good" BOS boils down to three ideas: goals, metrics, and continuous improvement.</p>
            <p>So what BOS should we / you use? Well, it's a long story. We'll skip Sumerians and record keeping, Renaissance and scientific method, Adam Smith and division of labor, industrial revolution and factories, and instead - jump right in with who I think are the Big Three (Deming, Ohno, and Wickman) to study.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Deming-Leadership-Principles-Quality/dp/0071790225" target="_blank" class="external-link">W. Edwards Deming</a> (1940s - 1990s): Total Quality Management, quality through statistical control and systemic thinking</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Production-System-Beyond-Large-Scale/dp/0915299143" target="_blank" class="external-link">Taiichi Ohno</a> (1940s - 1980s): Toyota Production System, lean manufacturing through waste reduction, efficiency, and continuous improvement (kaizen)</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business/dp/1936661837" target="_blank" class="external-link">Gino Wickman</a> (2000s - present): Entrepreneurial Operating System, organizational alignment and execution through structured processes and tools</p>
            <p>Getting this list down to three was hard! While early pioneers of scientific management, like Frederick Taylor, are useful to read and understand, the ideas are really just foundational.</p>
            <p>Then there are dozens of quasi-systems (Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma) that are just riffs off TPS. I'm also excluding great "private label brands" of BOS like Danaher Business System or Amazon's operating system because getting access to them is inconsistent and the operating systems are constantly updating.</p>
            <p>Gino Wickman and EOS is the only <em>publicly available</em> BOS that incorporates every useful tool (OKRs, theory of constraints, etc) of the last century. EOS is the fastest, easiest, lowest cost operating system available on the market. If you study one BOS, pick this one, because it aggregates <em>everything.</em></p>
